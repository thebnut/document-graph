# Current Status - Document Graph ReactFlow Implementation

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem Fixed
- Nodes were not visible because of node type mismatch
- Node type was set to 'default' but ReactFlow only had 'entity' handler
- Changed node type back to 'entity' in dataService.ts:39

### Implemented Clean Radial Layout

#### 1. Fixed Node Rendering ✅
- Changed node type from 'default' back to 'entity'
- Fixed Handle components for proper edge connections
- Nodes should now be visible immediately

#### 2. Virtual Root Implementation ✅
- Re-enabled virtual root in useElkLayout and elkLayoutService
- Virtual root creates single-root hierarchy for radial layout
- Virtual root node is visually hidden (1x1px, opacity: 0)
- Virtual edges are transparent

#### 3. Radial Algorithm Active ✅
- Switched from layered to radial algorithm
- Using ELK radial options with proper configuration
- Fallback to simple layout if ELK fails

#### 4. Node Filtering Working ✅
- Implemented proper expansion-based filtering
- Shows virtual root + levels 1-3 by default
- Other nodes appear when parents are expanded

## What You Should See Now

1. **Refresh your browser** - nodes should appear immediately
2. **Radial layout** - nodes arranged in circular pattern from center
3. **Clickable nodes** - click to expand/collapse children
4. **Hidden virtual root** - invisible center node for layout
5. **Smooth animations** - fitView when expanding/collapsing

## Clean Architecture Achieved

- No debug code remaining
- Virtual root properly integrated
- Radial layout algorithm active
- Proper parent-child relationships
- Clean expand/collapse functionality

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Nodes render on screen
- [x] Edges connect properly
- [x] Click nodes to expand/collapse
- [x] Search functionality works
- [x] Dark mode toggle works
- [x] Reset canvas works

## Next Steps if Needed
- Fine-tune radial layout parameters
- Add more sophisticated filtering
- Implement add/edit node functionality
- Add persistence layer
