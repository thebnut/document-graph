# Debug Status - Please Test Now

## Changes Made to Fix Node Visibility

### 1. Fixed Initialization Order âœ…
- Moved edge loading to happen BEFORE useElkLayout hook
- Edges are now available when layout calculates

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debugging âœ…
Console logs added throughout to trace:
- Initial nodes/edges loading
- Virtual root preparation  
- Layout calculation
- Node filtering
- Final display nodes

### 3. Fixed Hook Dependencies âœ…
- Changed from watching `edges.length` to `edges` array
- Layout will now re-run when edges change

## Please Test Now!

**ðŸ”„ REFRESH YOUR BROWSER** and open the console (F12 â†’ Console tab)

You should see console output like:
```
[App] Initial nodes loaded: 12 [...]
[App] Initial edges loaded: 11 [...]
[useElkLayout] Initializing with nodes: 12
[useElkLayout] Prepared nodes with virtual root: 13 [...]
[useElkLayout] Initial layout effect triggered - nodes: 13 edges: 11
[useElkLayout] applyLayout called with 13 nodes and 11 edges
[elkLayoutService] filterVisibleNodes called with 13 nodes
[elkAdapter] calculateElkLayout called with 13 nodes and 11 edges
[elkAdapter] ELK graph prepared: {...}
[elkAdapter] ELK layout complete: {...}
[useElkLayout] Layout complete, nodes with positions: 13 [...]
[App] displayNodes: X [...]
[App] nodesToDisplay: X [...]
```

## What to Look For

1. **Check displayNodes count** - Should be > 0
2. **Check nodesToDisplay count** - Should be > 0  
3. **Look for any errors** in console
4. **Check if nodes have positions** in the logs

## If Still No Nodes Visible

Please share:
1. The complete console output
2. Any errors you see
3. What the counts are for displayNodes/nodesToDisplay

The debugging will tell us exactly where nodes are being lost in the pipeline.
