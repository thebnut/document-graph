# Solution Status - Fixed Node Rendering Issue

## Root Cause Identified and Fixed

The issue was that we were passing the wrong nodes array to ReactFlow. We had:
- `nodes` - the state managed by ReactFlow's `useNodesState` hook
- `nodesToDisplay` - our filtered/processed nodes
- `displayNodes` - from the useElkLayout hook

But we were:
1. Updating `nodes` state via `onNodesChange` callback
2. Then passing `nodesToDisplay` to ReactFlow instead of `nodes`
3. This caused a mismatch - ReactFlow expected to render `nodes` but we gave it a different array

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed ReactFlow nodes prop
Changed from:
```jsx
<ReactFlow nodes={nodesToDisplay} ...>
```
To:
```jsx
<ReactFlow nodes={processedNodes} ...>
```

### 2. Fixed node state management
- Now properly using the `nodes` state from `useNodesState`
- Processing nodes (adding handlers, search) in a `useMemo` hook
- Ensuring ReactFlow gets the correct processed nodes

### 3. Fixed visible nodes filtering
- Only passing visible nodes to ReactFlow state in useElkLayout hook
- This ensures we don't have hidden nodes taking up space

## What You Should See Now

**ðŸ”„ Please refresh your browser**

You should now see:
1. **5 nodes rendered** (virtual root hidden, brett, gemma, home-property, family-docs)
2. **Nodes positioned** in a tree layout (fallback layout since radial failed)
3. **Edges connecting** the nodes
4. **Click to expand** functionality working

## Console Output Expected
```
[App] Final check - nodes state: 5 processed: 5
[App] First processed node: virtual-root at {x: 400, y: -100}
```

## If Still Not Working

The debug logs will show:
- How many nodes are in the state
- If they have positions
- Any remaining errors

Please share the new console output after refreshing!
