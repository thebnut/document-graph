# Node Expansion Fix Status

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CLAUDE.md
Added troubleshooting section documenting the fix for nodes not rendering. The key issue was passing the wrong nodes array to ReactFlow - must use the `nodes` state from `useNodesState` hook.

### 2. Added Debugging
- Added console logs to `toggleNodeExpansion` in useElkLayout.ts
- Added console logs to `onNodeClick` in App.tsx  
- Added console logs to `filterVisibleNodes` in elkLayoutService.ts

### 3. Fixed Node References
Changed `onNodeClick` to use `nodes` from state instead of `elkNodes` from the hook.

### 4. Switched to Layered Algorithm
Changed from radial to layered algorithm in elkAdapter.ts as radial was causing errors.

## What the Debugging Will Show

When you click on a node now, you'll see:
1. Which node was clicked and if it has children
2. How many children were found in the current visible nodes
3. The expansion state before and after toggle
4. Which nodes are being filtered as visible

## The Real Issue

Based on the data structure, the problem is likely that:
- Brett and Gemma both have `hasChildren: true`
- But their children (home-property, family-docs) have `parentIds: ["brett", "gemma"]` (both parents)
- These children are already visible at level 3 (adjusted from original level 2)
- So clicking Brett or Gemma doesn't reveal any new nodes

The expansion logic needs to handle:
1. Nodes with multiple parents
2. Showing children only when ALL required parents are expanded
3. Or showing children when ANY parent is expanded (current behavior with `.some()`)

## Next Steps

1. **Test with the debugging** - Click on nodes and check console output
2. **Verify the data model** - Check if there are actually any exclusive children of Brett or Gemma
3. **Adjust filtering logic** if needed to handle multi-parent relationships
4. **Add more test data** with exclusive children to properly test expansion
