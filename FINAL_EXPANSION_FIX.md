# Final Expansion Fix - Double Filtering Issue Resolved

## The Problem
The expansion was actually working, but nodes weren't showing because of double filtering:
1. Nodes were filtered once when passing to ReactFlow (in useElkLayout)
2. Nodes were filtered again for display (in App component)

The first filter was limiting what ReactFlow saw, so even though the expansion logic worked, the newly visible nodes weren't in ReactFlow's state.

## The Solution

### 1. Removed First Filter ✅
In `useElkLayout.ts`:
- Changed from passing only visible nodes to ReactFlow
- Now passes ALL nodes with positions
- ReactFlow manages all nodes, visibility is controlled by display only

### 2. Fixed Display Filtering ✅
In `App.tsx`:
- Changed processedNodes to use `displayNodes` instead of `nodes`
- This ensures we show only what should be visible based on expansion
- Maintains proper filtering based on expandedNodes state

## How It Works Now

1. **All nodes get positions** from the layout algorithm
2. **All nodes are in ReactFlow state** (not just visible ones)
3. **Display filtering** controls what's actually shown
4. **When you expand a node**, the children are already positioned and just become visible

## Testing

**Please refresh your browser** and you should now see:

1. Click "22 Banya St" → Insurance, Cleaner, Gardener appear
2. Click "Family Documents" → Passports, Medicare, Health Insurance appear
3. Click again → They disappear (collapse)

The console will show:
- `[useElkLayout] Passing all layouted nodes to ReactFlow: 13`
- `[App] Final check - nodes state: 13 processed: 5` (or more when expanded)
